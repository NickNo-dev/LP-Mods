Porn Empire (LifePlay) ReadMe, Change Log and TODO List
========================================================

ReadMe
********

Porn Empire is a LifePlay mod (add-on) that allows you to run your own 
porn business in LifePlay. You start at a very low level taking pictures 
and videos with your smart phone of your sex workers and your perverted dates.
Over time your business grows and you can buy more equipment and employ 
workers that will assist you in your daily tasks.

Earning money in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Money can be earned by launching a website and putting picture sets or 
videos online. Picture sets and videos will be downloaded by your visitors 
as soon as you release them and they will pay money for that.
* If you have famous models you will get more visitors.
* Model fame grows with an increasing download count.
* If you get better equipment you will get more valuable sets / videos.
* The older a set / video gets the more its value drops.

Money is currently earned by launching the "Check business performance" 
action in the sex work tab.

Getting picture sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just launch the action "Do a sexy photo shooting" from the sex work tab. 
If you have a companion the companion will be asked to take part in the 
session otherwise you can choose one of your contacts.

If the chosen model is not a sex worker or not perverted enough he/she will 
decline. Try your luck to convince him/her if his/her masochist stat is low 
enough.

Every model will ask for money. You may try to negotiate as well.

You have different shooting options to chose from. Just try them out. NOW!

By the way, if you convinced someone to become a model the tag "PEModel" 
will be added to this contact.


Uploading stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you managed to launch your website (action "Launch a porn website" in the 
sex work tab) you can upload previously created picture sets and videos to it. 
You should do that right after doing some shoots as nobody will be able to see 
your new work if you do not upload it.

A web admin could do that task for you and improve the quality of the uploaded 
sets but will cost some money.


Porn fame in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The porn fame of a model affects the amount of money you earn with him/her. 
Sets of famous models keep the interest in them high for a longer time. 

So a shooting with a famous model costs more money, but the results will be 
better and the demand for them will last longer.

Additionally the models attractiveness affects the value of her/his work. 
... and of course the price ;-)

If a models fame changes after doing a shoot this will also affect the 
value of the footage.

The porn fame of a photographer affects the quality (and therefore price) 
of the shooting results. A famous photographer is also more expensive.
